Used the Keras sequential library to build a model with multiple dense layers.
This model achieved a 93% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

Worked with the Fashion MNIST dataset and the CIFAR 10 datasets. Developed architectures to correctly classify images in both datasets.

Did a Text classification (sentiment analysis) with deep learning models using the IMDB movie reviews dataset for a sentiment classification task.
